# What is AdTech 
**Advertising Technology (AdTech) leverages digital innovations to enhance the scope and effectiveness of advertising efforts.** Traditionally, advertising primarily relied on mass media channels such as television, radio, newspapers, and magazines to reach broad audiences. However, with the widespread adoption of the internet and the explosive growth of social networks, the paradigm shifted, making it significantly more efficient to engage with users through these digital ecosystems. This evolution transformed how advertisers connect with consumers, allowing for **more precise targeting and broader reach** across platforms like social media (e.g., Instagram, Facebook), search engines (e.g., Google), and popular messaging applications (e.g., LINE).


# Key Components and Terminologies in Modern AdTech

## Core Platforms:
- **Demand-Side Platforms (DSPs)**: The "playground" for advertisers where they register and run advertisements, and check numbers to improve efficiency. Main roles include ad serving (ranking ads) and ad management (registration, features, reporting tools).
- **Supply-Side Platforms (SSPs)**: The "placements" where advertisements are shown to users, such as LINE Timeline, LINE News, or partner apps.
- These two components are standard in the ad industry, and a system should be built to support both.
## Data Infrastructure:
- **Data Management Platform (DMP)**: A centralized system, like LINE DMP, that collects, processes, and provides advertising data for internal use, feeding B2B services like LINE Ads and LINE Official Accounts. It stores user information.
- **Feature Stores**: Systems like LINE's z-features that store cross-service logs from consented users, collecting permitted data across services and integrating it for machine learning models.
- **Data Pipelines**: Systems responsible for storing logs from the entire ad platform and extracting precise payment information.
- **Business Manager**: A platform that allows advertisers to effectively utilize diverse data across all of LINE's marketing products by consolidating and managing data from connected accounts (e.g., LINE Ads and LINE Official Accounts). It enables data sharing between accounts across brands within the same company.

## Key Terminologies & Concepts:
- **User Persona System**: Estimates usersâ€™ demographic (e.g., gender, age) and psychographic (e.g., interests like music, fashion, travel, games) profiles using machine learning methods from consented service logs4.... This is used for targeting ads and addressing "cold start problems" for new services.
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR) Prediction**: Essential for optimizing ad delivery.
- **Conversion Rate (CVR) Prediction**: More difficult than CTR prediction due to conversion events occurring over a longer period (even 30 days later) and often being rare and dirty data.
- **Auto Bidding**: Adjusts bidding amounts to maximize advertiser efficiency based on conversion events and budget constraints, aiming to get more conversions for a lower price.
- **Look-alike Modeling**: Finds users similar to an advertiser's main customers to target ads, based on the belief that these similar users are likely to buy the product.
- **Agentic AI**: An emerging solution that can automate repetitive tasks, optimize decision-making, and manage data collection, database management, and content delivery, freeing marketing and CX teams for strategic initiatives. It can proactively offer personalized recommendations.
- **Generative Advertising**: AI-generated responses influenced by commercial factors, which are dynamic, personalized, and lack clear provenance, making them distinct from static advertisements. Examples include product recommendations, product placement, and paid visibility.
- **Seamless Adformatives**: A future concept where dynamic ad content blends into content without disturbance and adds value beyond just being an ad.


# Learnings from [Technovate Strategy](https://www.globis.ac.jp/courses/technovate-strategy/) 
- **Strategic Alignment in Layered Ecosystems:** In dynamic business environments, success hinges on understanding the **layered structure of technology and its deep integration with overall business strategy**. While competition intensifies at each of these interlinked layers, **cross-functional collaboration and external partnerships are paramount** for achieving sustained growth and innovation. For example, the evolution of LINE's business manager and advertising platforms demonstrates the necessity of connecting various internal systems, like LINE Ads and LINE Official Accounts, and unifying data across different brands to facilitate shared data utilization. This interconnectedness requires **aligning technology teams with marketing and customer experience (CX) specialists** to bridge silos and ensure efforts are cohesive.
    
- **Data and AI as Strategic Moats:** **Proprietary data ownership** combined with advanced **Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms** are critical for establishing a **defensible competitive advantage** (a "moat"). These technological assets enable organizations to move beyond basic customer understanding to **anticipating customer needs**, fostering next-level personalization that can drive revenue growth and boost productivity. LINE's user persona system, which uses ML to estimate demographic and psychographic profiles from consented user logs, is a prime example of leveraging data and algorithms to deliver useful content and enhance services like LINE Display Ads, LINE Official Account messaging, and new service cold-start problem solutions. Similarly, the LINE Ads Platform continuously evolves with ML models for CTR and CVR prediction, auto-bidding, and "look-alike" audience generation, all designed to increase advertiser efficiency and create a distinctive offering. This synergistic combination of unique application services, powered by data and AI, can significantly enhance **customer engagement and loyalty**, effectively increasing switching costs and **locking in customers** by making them "feel known".
    
- **Combating Commoditization Through Value Creation from Data:** The **inevitability of commoditization** across various technological layers, from hardware to foundational software components like web applications, necessitates a proactive strategy of continuous innovation. Simply creating a "simple application" no longer guarantees differentiation. To remain competitive and prevent easy replication, digital businesses must **continuously add new, higher-value layers, primarily by extracting unique and actionable insights from data**. The shift from generic, ad-hoc AI tools to **domain-specific AI models, tailored to a company's unique data and workflows**, is a key differentiator for high-maturity organizations. For instance, LINE's revamp of its user persona system, moving from older, harder-to-maintain technologies to modern, flexible infrastructures like Kubernetes and PyTorch, demonstrates the need to constantly update underlying layers to support new functionalities and maintain a competitive edge. The future of digital advertising, for example, emphasizes moving beyond static advertisements to **dynamic, personalized "generative advertisements"** that are seamlessly integrated into user interactions and derive their content from both traditional and sponsored information, highlighting the creation of new value from data. This strategic investment in data-driven innovation and specialized AI capabilities is crucial to ensuring that digital businesses remain unique and difficult to copy.
